# PDF417.mobi core components

This repository used to host native build (core components) of PDF417.mobi for those use cases when user wanted to have its own camera management instead of provided one on mobile platforms (iOS and Android) or in cases when desktop barcode scanning was required (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Since version 5.0.0 we have also added 64-bit builds for Android platform, but static libraries are larger than 100 MB and since this breaks the Github's limit on file size, we decided to host new builds on our own server.

If you are interested in trying out the latest core components build, please contact as at [help.microblink.com](http://help.microblink.com).

For time being, this repository will host the old 4.1 version of core components.

Doxygen generated documentation is available in doc/index.html.
