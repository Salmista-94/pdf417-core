                                frames obtained from camera - all these frames should contain the same object that needs to be
                                recognised. If one of this frames contain different object, total recognition result may be
                                corrupted. To reset recognizer to initial setting, call recognizerReset (@see recognizerReset).
                                Also note that returned recognizer result may be NULL or not valid for frames for which library
                                concludes are too poor to be processed. If you want to force library to process every frame, set
                                this parameter to zero. In that case time redundancy information from consecutive frames will not
